# smp.no - Image zoom

A Firefox/Chrome extension that adds a link under each image of articles at smp.no, 
so you can view full quality images without the hassle of altering the image link.

smp.no reduces the quality of images by appending a search params to the url, like so:
`?fit=clip&h=800&w=1000&tight=false`.

This extension adds a link under each image that opens a new tab with the image
without those search params.
